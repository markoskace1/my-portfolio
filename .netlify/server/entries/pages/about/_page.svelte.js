I&#39;ve started developing websites in my college
				years as a hobby, when Bootstrap was popular and React framework was still not around. I&#39;ve
				been pursuing my career as a <strong>developer for more than 4 years</strong> now as a freelancer.
				My work mostly consists of front-end development, but recently got into back-end too. I can do
				API calls, implementing a CMS and I&#39;m just finishing building a website with user authentication.
				I could say I&#39;m senior front-end and junior back-end developer. Well, you be the judge. ðŸ˜…</p> <p>Like I&#39;ve said before, I had started with plain <strong>HTML+CSS, Bootstrap</strong> and a
				little bit of <strong>JS.</strong> I haven&#39;t commited myself fully to web development at
				that time, it was just a hobby for me to explore and learn what web technology can do. Years
				later, my friend told me about <strong>ReactJS</strong> and I really liked it, but there was
				still something missing. I&#39;ve discovered <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> and was hooked ðŸ˜‰
				immediately and bacame a big fan. There was not a project I would make without using TailwindCSS.
				It was so refreshing, logical and efficient.</p> <p>Than, <strong>Svelte</strong> came along, which quickly replaced React. Don&#39;t worry I still
				use it sometimes in my projects, mostly in <strong>AstroJS</strong> (another really cool
				framework) as an island component. I&#39;m also have some designing skills too. I&#39;m familiar
				with
				<strong>Figma</strong> and I like to design logos and retouch images in
				<strong>Gimp and Inkscape</strong> myself. You see, this portfolio page, I had to design it quickly
				and was mostly from my imagination directly into IDE.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working as a <strong>freelancer on Upwork</strong> for some time and made some
				great and interesting projects. I fluently speak
				<stong>English and know some German</stong>. Besides web development, I occasionaly do real
				estate photography and have great passion for investing and trading on financial markets. I
				have a great family with lovely two kids which mean most to me.</p> <p>I&#39;m <strong>abitious and determined and creative</strong>. I&#39;m looking for a job that will
				challenge me and help me grow as a developer. I&#39;m eager to work on exciting projects and
				collaborate with other talented programmers. I&#39;m always open to learning new skills and
				technologies and like to solve problems.</p> <p>If I find you interesting, please contact me, invite me to an interview, or at least
				remember me for the next time, when you&#39;ll need somebody that loves Tailwind and knows
				Svelte. ðŸ˜œ</p> <p>Thank you for the opportunity and an awesome framework!</p></div></div></section>`;
